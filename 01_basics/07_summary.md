# Data Type

- Primitives are the simplest and most basic data types in JavaScript. They include:

- Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)
- Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')
- Booleans (e.g. true, false)
- Null (a special value that represents an absence of value)
- Undefined (a special value that represents an uninitialized variable)
-  

# There are several types of operators in JavaScript, including:

- Comparison operators (e.g. >, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
- Logical operators (e.g. &&, ||, !)
- Arithmetic operators (e.g. +, -, *, /, %)
- Assignment operators (e.g. =, +=, -=, *=, /=)
- Conditional (ternary) operator (e.g. ?:)
